## ⚒️ Working Habit

> When I’m assigned a new feature, I begin by visualizing the end‑user experience and mapping that vision to a high‑level technical flow—essentially working in a **LIFO style** so the most recent priorities get immediate attention.

With a clear design in mind, I use **large language models** to draft the initial implementation. I review the generated code carefully—if it covers about **70 %** of what I need, I pull it into Visual Studio and refine it further.

I compile early and often. The quicker I fix build-time issues, the sooner I can tackle runtime errors and edge cases.

**🔍 Breakpoint Strategy (Hierarchy):**
1. 🔢 Variable assignments and key calculations  
2. 🧮 SQL queries (also tested in Azure Data Studio)  
3. 🔄 Entry points (e.g., `Page_Load` or component initializers)

This **iterative, feedback-driven workflow** allows me to deliver high-confidence, production-ready code efficiently.
