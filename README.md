<h2>⚒️ Working Habit</h2>
<pre>
    When I’m assigned a new feature, I begin by visualizing the end‑user experience and mapping
    that vision to a high‑level technical flow—essentially working in a LIFO style so the most
    recent priorities get immediate attention. With a clear design in mind, I use large
    language models to generate an initial code draft. I review the output carefully,
    and if it captures roughly 70 % of the functionality I need, I pull it into 
    Visual Studio and refine it by hand.

    I compile early and often; the sooner I clear build‑time issues, the sooner I can expose runtime
    errors and edge cases. My breakpoint strategy follows a strict hierarchy:
        1. Critical variable assignments or calculations
        2. SQL queries—which I also test in Azure Data Studio for quick validation
        3. The entry point of the page or component (e.g., Page_Load) to trace overall execution

    This iterative, feedback‑driven approach lets me deliver working code quickly while maintaining
    a high level of confidence in its correctness.</pre>
